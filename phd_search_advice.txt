# Advice for people searching for a PhD lab

Choose 30-50 universities where you would imagine yourself living at
Then shortlist for each universities the professors that you would work with
If it is very hard to find people you would be willing to work, try to consider if you are being too restrictive on your topic
Some universities may have no one with which you would work with, but some may have many
The analysis of the research shouldn't be too detailed. First just do a basic shortlist with people with remotely interesting research for you
After that, look into more detail of each of those people and check their publications. Just reading the abstracts of 3 of the most important (big journal or most cited) recent publications (the last 5 years).
After reading each abstract, close your eyes and think if you would be proud of having published that article. If the answer is no to all three. Remove that person from you list. If it is yes for any of the three  publications, then keep that person on your list.
After this process, your list of 30-50 places should have reduced to about 10-30. Apply to all these places
When you contact the professor, mention one or more of his papers that you are interested on and why.



To find people Working on the topics you want, you can use the influence tab at Semantic Scholar author page: e.g. https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/James-L.-McClelland/1701656
Keep in mind that it will point you towards big names, generally.

Assistant professors are the early career PIs. Associate professors are already tenured.

# Contacting professors

I would say that contacting the professors beforehand is very important. Some professors will not reply, but a lot of people will reply and tell you if they support you applying to their program. It is good so you have a feeling if people are interested in you. Some professors may want to informally talk to you before the actual interview process. If the professor is interested in you they may intervene so to maximize your chances of being accepted for interviews.
